OK, we've managed to remove unnecessary row elements. Now we need a second script. The task is on the same line with privileges : [ 
Add 1 or more items. We must take the new elements from the file. (Let the name of the file containing the elements to add be the last parameter of the script call, these elements in the file can be specified either in quotation marks or without, each element on a new line)

# Рассуждения
We are going to create a script that:
 1. Reads an input JSON file (first argument) and a file containing new privileges (last argument).
 2. The new privileges file has one privilege per line, which may or may not be in quotes.
 3. We will look for the line containing `"privileges" : [` in the JSON file.
 4. We will extract the existing array of privileges and then add the new privileges from the file (if they are not already present).
 5. We will then rewrite the line with the updated array.
 Steps for the script:
 - Read the new privileges from the file (last argument). We will strip each line and remove surrounding quotes if present.
 - Process the input JSON file line by line until we find the target line.
 - In the target line, we extract the current array string and parse it as JSON to a list.
 - For each new privilege, if it is not already in the list, add it (as a string).
 - Then, we convert the updated list back to a JSON string (without extra spaces) and replace the old array string in the line.
 - Write the rest of the lines as is.
 Important: We assume that the array is on a single line and does not span multiple lines.
 However, note: the previous script handled an array that might be complex. But in this task, we are only adding string elements.
 Let's design:
 Example of target line: `  "privileges" : ["A", "B"],`
 Steps for the target line:
  1. Find the pattern `"privileges" : [`.
  2. Extract the entire array string (from the '[' to the matching ']').
 We can reuse the `extract_array_string` function from the previous script.
 Then:
   existing_privileges = list of current privileges (which might be a mix of types, but we are only adding strings)
   We read the new privileges from the file, and for each new privilege string (cleaned and without quotes if they are surrounding the entire string) we add it only if it is not already in the existing_privileges.
   But note: the existing_privileges might contain non-string items? According to the previous task, we left non-string items. But in this task, we are only adding string items.
   We will only add the new privileges as strings.
   However, we must be cautious: the existing array might have non-string items (like numbers, booleans, null). We are only concerned with adding new string privileges.
   We do not remove any existing items.
 3. After updating the list, we generate a new array string by using `json.dumps(existing_privileges)`.
 4. Then replace the old array string with the new one in the line.
 We assume the array is on one line? Actually, the previous script worked for one line. But the array might span multiple lines? The problem says "the one containing", meaning the line that has the pattern. But the array might start on that line and extend to multiple lines. However, the previous solution extracted the array string by matching brackets. We can use the same function.
 But note: the previous function `extract_array_string` was designed to work on a single string (the line) and it started at a given index. However, if the array spans multiple lines, we need to consider multiple lines.
 However, the problem says: "Leave all lines in the file unchanged except the one containing ...". So it implies the entire array is in one line? Or does the problem consider the array as part of one logical line?
 Let me clarify: the previous script processed one line at a time. But if the array is multi-line, then the pattern `"privileges" : [` would be in the first line of the array, and the rest of the array would be in subsequent lines. Therefore, we cannot process it line by line.
 We have two options:
   a) Change the script to read the entire file as a string and then process the privileges array (using the same bracket matching but on the entire string). Then we don't need to worry about lines.
   b) Or, if the array is always in one line, then we can stick to line-by-line.
 But the problem says: "the one containing", meaning one line. So if the array spans multiple lines, then the pattern is only in the first line. We would have to combine the following lines until we get the entire array.
 However, to keep consistent with the previous script, we might do:
   We read the entire file as a string? Or we can read line by line and when we find the pattern, we start accumulating until we have the entire array.
 Since the previous script did not handle multi-line, but the problem states "the line", I think we are safe to assume the array is in one line? But let's be cautious.
 Actually, the previous script's `extract_array_string` function was designed to work on a string that might contain multiple lines? No, because we were passing one line at a time. But if the array spans multiple lines, then we would not find the closing bracket in the same line, and the function would return the substring until the end of the line? That would break.
 Therefore, we must change the approach: read the entire file as a string and then find the pattern and extract the array from the entire string.
 Alternatively, we can read the file line by line and when we find the pattern, we remember the starting position and then continue reading until we have the entire array.
 Given the complexity, I propose:
   Option 1: Read the entire file into a string and process the array in that string. Then write the entire string to the output.
   Option 2: Read line by line and when we find the pattern, we combine the current line and subsequent lines until we have the entire array. Then we process that combined string and then write the lines appropriately.
 Since the file might be large, reading the entire file into memory might not be efficient. But if we assume the file is not huge, we can do Option 1.
 But the problem does not specify the file size, so let's go with Option 2 for memory efficiency.
 Steps for Option 2:
   We read the input file line by line, but we keep a state:
   - We are either in normal mode or in the middle of processing the privileges array.
   How:
   - We look for the pattern `"privileges" : [` in each line. If found, we note the index in the line and then start accumulating the entire array string until we have the matching closing bracket.
   - We use the `extract_array_string` function but on the entire string from the current line and the following lines until we get the complete array.
   - We then parse the array string, add the new privileges, and then replace the array string with the new one.
   - Then we break the new array string into lines? But note: we want to preserve the original formatting? The problem says "leave all lines unchanged" except for the content of the array. But we are allowed to change the array content, but the structure? We are replacing the entire array string. We can format the new array as a single line? Or we can try to preserve the original formatting? The problem doesn't specify.
   However, to minimize the change, we can format the new array as a single line. But note: the original array might have been multi-line. But the problem says we are only changing the line containing the pattern? Actually, we are changing the array which might span multiple lines. So we are replacing multiple lines with one line? That might be acceptable.
   Alternatively, we can format the array in the same way? But that is complex.
   Since the problem does not specify, I will output the array in a compact form (without extra spaces) on one line. This might change the formatting of the entire array (if it was multi-line) to a single line.
   If we want to preserve the original formatting, we would have to do more work. Let's assume it's acceptable to output the array as a single line.
   Steps:
     state = 'normal'
     collected_lines = []   # for the array content
     start_index = None     # the index in the first line where the array starts (the '[')
     We are going to iterate over the lines.
     For each line:
        if state is 'normal':
            if the pattern is found in the current line, then:
                set state = 'in_array'
                record the start index (the position of the '[' in the current line)
                set current_array_string = the substring of the current line from start_index to the end, and then we start accumulating.
                Also, we set a bracket counter: initially 1 (because we have the opening bracket we found) and then we process the rest of the current line and then subsequent lines until the counter becomes zero.
        if state is 'in_array':
            we continue accumulating the string until we have matched the brackets.
        How to accumulate:
            We have a variable `array_str` that starts with the substring from the start_index in the first line.
            Then we read the next lines and append them to `array_str` until we have a complete array (bracket counter becomes zero).
            We use the same bracket counting logic as in `extract_array_string` but now we are starting from a string that already has the opening bracket and we are appending entire lines.
        Once we have the entire array string (including the closing bracket), we break.
        Then we parse the array string, add the new privileges, and then generate the new array string (compact, one line).
        Then we replace the original array (which spanned multiple lines) with the new array string.
        How to output:
            The first line (where the pattern was found) we output the part before the array start, then the new array string, and then the part of the last accumulated line after the array string? But note: the array might end in the middle of a line.
        Actually, we are accumulating multiple lines until we have the entire array. Then we know the entire array string. Then we replace that entire string (which spans one or more lines) with the new array string (which is one line). Then we write:
            - The first line: from the beginning to the start_index (exclusive) + the new array string.
            - Then the rest of the last line after the array string (if the array ended in the middle of a line, we have to output the rest of that line).
        But note: the array string we extracted includes the entire array including the closing bracket. So we know exactly how many characters from the last line are part of the array.
        However, we are accumulating the entire array string. We don't know how many lines and how many characters per line. So we have to break the last line: we have the entire array string, and we know the array string was built by concatenating the lines (or parts of lines). Actually, we started with a part of the first line and then the entire subsequent lines until we had the array.
        Alternatively, we can store the lines that are part of the array and then replace them with the new array string and then output the remaining part of the last line.
        This becomes complicated.
   Considering the complexity and that the problem says "the one line", I will assume the array is on one line. But if we want to handle multi-line, we have to do the above.
   Since the problem does not specify, and the previous script also did not handle multi-line, I will assume the array is on one line.
   So we will process the file line by line and when we find the pattern, we expect the entire array to be in that same line. If not, we will try to extract the array from that line and the next lines until we get the entire array? Actually, the previous script did that in the same line? It tried to extract the array from the current line and if the closing bracket was not found, it returned the substring until the end. That would break.
   Therefore, to be safe, let's do:
      We read the entire file as a string and process the array in one go.
   Given that the file is not expected to be huge, we can do:
      with open(input_file) as f:
          data = f.read()
      Then we find the pattern `"privileges" : [` and then extract the array string from the entire data.
   Then we replace the array string with the new one.
   Then write the entire string to the output.
   This is simpler.
   Steps:
      Step 1: Read the entire input file into a string `data`.
      Step 2: Find the pattern `"privileges" : [` and get the starting index of the array (the '[') at `start_idx = pos + len(pattern) - 1` (because the pattern includes the '[').
      Step 3: Extract the array string from `start_idx` to the matching closing bracket in the entire string (using the `extract_array_string` function, but now on the entire string from `start_idx`).
      Step 4: Parse the array string to a list.
      Step 5: Read the new privileges from the file (last argument). Clean each line: strip and remove surrounding quotes if present.
      Step 6: For each new privilege, if it is not already in the list, append it (as a string).
      Step 7: Convert the updated list to a JSON string (compact, without spaces) -> `new_array_str = json.dumps(updated_list)`
      Step 8: Replace the old array string in `data` with `new_array_str`.
      Step 9: Write the entire `data` to the output file.
   Example:
        data = ... the whole file ...
        pattern = '"privileges" : ['
        pos = data.find(pattern)
        if pos == -1:
            # not found, then write the data as is
        else:
            start_idx = pos + len(pattern) - 1   # because pattern ends with '[' and we want the index of the '['
            old_array_str = extract_array_string(data, start_idx)
            if old_array_str is None:
                # error, but we leave as is
            else:
                # parse old_array_str
                # add new privileges
                new_data = data[:start_idx] + new_array_str + data[start_idx+len(old_array_str):]
   Then write new_data.
   The function `extract_array_string` we used in the previous script is designed to work on a substring of a string, so we can use it.
   But note: the previous function did not handle multi-line? Actually, it does because we are reading the entire string. The function iterates over the string from `start_idx` to the end, and it handles newline characters as any other character. So it should work.
   We will reuse the `extract_array_string` function.
   Also, we must be cautious: there might be multiple occurrences of `"privileges" : [`. The problem does not specify. We are to process the first one? or all? The problem says "the one containing", which might be the first? But let's assume there is only one.
   If there are multiple, we might process the first one. We can extend to process all? The problem does not specify. We'll do the first occurrence.
   If we need to process every occurrence, we would have to do in a loop. But the problem says "the one", so we assume one.
   Steps for the script:
      sys.argv[1] = input JSON file
      sys.argv[2] ... until the last one is the file with new privileges? Actually, the last argument is the file with new privileges.
      Example: 
          python script.py input.json new_privs.txt
          or 
          python script.py input.json output.json new_privs.txt
      How many arguments?
        We can have:
          script.py input [output] new_privs
        If there are 3 arguments: input, output, new_privs
        If there are 2 arguments: input and new_privs (then output to stdout? or overwrite input? The problem doesn't specify)
      Let's design:
          Usage: python script.py input_file new_privileges_file [output_file]
          If output_file is not provided, then output to stdout.
      Steps:
          Read input_file entirely into a string.
          Read new_privileges_file: 
              with open(new_privileges_file) as f_priv:
                  lines = f_priv.readlines()
              new_privs = []
              for line in lines:
                  line = line.strip()
                  if len(line) == 0:
                      continue
                  # if the line starts and ends with quotes, remove them
                  if line.startswith('"') and line.endswith('"'):
                      line = line[1:-1]
                  new_privs.append(line)
          Then find the pattern in the data.
          If found, extract the array string, parse it, and add the new privileges (if not already present).
          Then replace and write.
      Note: We are adding only string privileges. We do not add duplicates.
      Example: if the array is `["a", "b", 123]` and we have a new privilege "c", then we get `["a", "b", 123, "c"]`.
      But note: the array might contain non-string items. We are only adding string items.
      We are not removing any existing items.
 Let's code accordingly.
 We'll reuse the `extract_array_string` function from the previous script.
 We'll also handle the case when the pattern is not found: then we output the data unchanged.
 Steps:
   import sys
   import json
   def extract_array_string(s, start_idx):
        ... (same as before)
   Read the arguments.
   Read the entire input file.
   Read the new privileges file and clean the privileges.
   Find the pattern.
   Process the array.
   Write the result.
 Example code:
   if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python script.py input_file new_privileges_file [output_file]")
        sys.exit(1)
   input_file = sys.argv[1]
   new_privs_file = sys.argv[-1]   # last argument
   output_file = None
   if len(sys.argv) == 4:
        output_file = sys.argv[2]   # because then: [0] script, [1] input, [2] output, [3] new_privs
   else:
        # then len(sys.argv)==3: [0] script, [1] input, [2] new_privs
        # so output to stdout
        pass
   Actually, let's fix: the last argument is always the new_privs_file. The one before last might be the output file? But if there are 3 arguments, then:
        sys.argv[1] = input_file
        sys.argv[2] = output_file
        sys.argv[3] = new_privs_file
   If there are 2 arguments:
        sys.argv[1] = input_file
        sys.argv[2] = new_privs_file
   So:
        args = sys.argv[1:]
        if len(args) < 2 or len(args) > 3:
            print("Usage: ...")
            exit(1)
        input_file = args[0]
        if len(args) == 3:
            output_file = args[1]
            new_privs_file = args[2]
        else:
            output_file = None   # output to stdout
            new_privs_file = args[1]
   Then:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
            data = f.read()
        with open(new_privs_file, 'r') as f_priv:
            lines = f_priv.readlines()
        new_privs_list = []
        for line in lines:
            line = line.strip()
            if line == '':
                continue
            if line.startswith('"') and line.endswith('"'):
                line = line[1:-1]
            elif line.startswith("'") and line.endswith("'"):
                line = line[1:-1]
            new_privs_list.append(line)
        pattern = '"privileges" : ['
        pos = data.find(pattern)
        if pos == -1:
            # not found, so we don't change data
            new_data = data
        else:
            start_idx = pos + len(pattern) - 1   # because the pattern ends with '[' and we want the index of that bracket
            old_array_str = extract_array_string(data, start_idx)
            if old_array_str is None:
                new_data = data
            else:
                try:
                    old_list = json.loads(old_array_str)
                except json.JSONDecodeError:
                    new_data = data
                else:
                    # We have the old_list, now add new_privs_list without duplicates
                    # We are going to add only string privileges that are not already present (as a string) in the old_list?
                    # But note: the old_list might have non-string items. We are only concerned with string duplicates?
                    # We want to avoid adding a string that is already present (even if there is a non-string with the same representation? no, because it's a string)
                    # Let current_string_privs = set of all string items in old_list
                    current_string_privs = set()
                    for item in old_list:
                        if isinstance(item, str):
                            current_string_privs.add(item)
                    # Now, for each new_priv in new_privs_list:
                    for priv in new_privs_list:
                        if priv not in current_string_privs:
                            old_list.append(priv)
                            current_string_privs.add(priv)   # to avoid duplicates in new_privs_list? actually, we might have duplicates in the new_privs_list, so we can do: if we care about duplicates in new_privs_list, we should avoid. But the problem says "add 1 or more items". So if the same item is repeated, we add only one.
                    # Now convert the updated old_list to JSON string
                    new_array_str = json.dumps(old_list)
                    new_data = data[:start_idx] + new_array_str + data[start_idx+len(old_array_str):]
        Then, if output_file:
            with open(output_file, 'w') as f_out:
                f_out.write(new_data)
        else:
            print(new_data)
 Let's code accordingly.
 Note: the pattern might appear multiple times? We are only processing the first occurrence. The problem says "the one", so we assume one.
 If we want to process every occurrence, we would have to loop. But the problem doesn't specify. We'll do the first occurrence.
 We'll write the script accordingly.


# Ответ

To solve this problem, we need to modify a JSON file by adding new privileges to an existing array identified by the pattern `"privileges" : [`. The new privileges are read from a separate file, where each privilege is listed on a new line, optionally enclosed in quotes. The solution involves processing the entire JSON file as a string to handle potential multi-line arrays, adding the new privileges while avoiding duplicates, and writing the updated content to an output file or stdout.

### Approach
1. **Read Input Files**: 
   - Read the entire content of the input JSON file into a string.
   - Read the file containing new privileges, stripping each line and removing surrounding quotes if present.

2. **Locate Privileges Array**:
   - Find the first occurrence of the pattern `"privileges" : [` in the JSON string.
   - Extract the entire array string starting from the opening bracket `[` to the matching closing bracket `]`.

3. **Process Privileges Array**:
   - Parse the extracted array string into a Python list.
   - Add new privileges from the file to this list, ensuring no duplicates (only string privileges are considered for duplication).
   - Convert the updated list back to a JSON string.

4. **Generate Output**:
   - Replace the original array string in the JSON content with the new array string.
   - Write the updated JSON content to the specified output file or print it to stdout.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
import json

def extract_array_string(s, start_idx):
    if start_idx >= len(s) or s[start_idx] != '[':
        return None
    stack = ['[']
    in_string = False
    escape = False
    end_index = None
    for i in range(start_idx + 1, len(s)):
        c = s[i]
        if not in_string:
            if c == '[':
                stack.append('[')
            elif c == ']':
                stack.pop()
                if len(stack) == 0:
                    end_index = i
                    break
            elif c == '"':
                in_string = True
        else:
            if escape:
                escape = False
            else:

### Explanation
1. **Reading Files**: The script reads the entire content of the input JSON file and the new privileges file into strings. The privileges file is processed to clean each line (stripping whitespace and removing surrounding quotes).
2. **Finding Privileges Array**: The script searches for the pattern `"privileges" : [` in the JSON string. If found, it extracts the entire array string by matching brackets, handling nested arrays and escaped characters within strings.
3. **Updating Privileges**: The extracted array string is parsed into a Python list. New privileges from the file are added to this list if they are not already present (considering only string privileges to avoid duplicates).
4. **Generating Output**: The updated list is converted back to a JSON string and replaces the original array in the JSON content. The result is written to the specified output file or printed to stdout.

This approach efficiently processes the JSON file, handles multi-line arrays, and ensures new privileges are added without duplicates, maintaining the integrity of the original JSON structure.
