Good. Now you need to write a second version of the same scripts, but the first one should create groups. And second script must assign the group a role to view the project.

# Рассуждения
We are now going to create two scripts:

The first script will create groups in TeamCity (instead of roles). We assume that the group names are provided in a file (one per line).

The second script will assign a group a role that grants view permission to a specific project.

Note: In TeamCity, we assign roles to groups (or users) at the project level. The typical role for viewing a project is "PROJECT_VIEWER".

However, note that the TeamCity REST API for assigning roles to groups is a bit different. We might need to use the following approach:

First, we need to know the internal ID of the group. We can get it by group name, but note that the group must exist.

Alternatively, we can assign the role to a group by name in the context of a project.

According to the TeamCity REST API documentation, we can assign a role to a group in a project by sending a POST request to:

/app/rest/projects/{projectLocator}/roles/{roleId}/groups/{groupLocator}

Where:

projectLocator: can be the project ID (e.g., id:project_id)

roleId: the role ID (e.g., PROJECT_VIEWER)

groupLocator: can be the group key (e.g., key:group_name) or the group name (if unique) but note that the group key is usually the same as the group name in TeamCity.

But note: The group must exist.

Alternatively, we can use the following endpoint to assign a role to a group in a project:

POST /app/rest/projects/{projectLocator}/roleGroups

With data in XML or JSON that specifies the group and the role.

However, after checking the TeamCity REST API documentation (which is not very detailed), I recall that we can also use:

PUT /app/rest/projects/{projectLocator}/roles/{roleId}/groups/{groupLocator}

But note: The exact method might vary by TeamCity version.

Given the complexity and potential variation, I will provide a method that uses the endpoint:

POST /app/rest/projects/{projectLocator}/roles/{roleId}/groups

With the group locator in the request body (as JSON or text). However, the documentation is not very clear.

Alternatively, I found that the following endpoint is used in some examples:

POST /app/rest/projects/{projectLocator}/roles/{roleId}/groups/{groupLocator}

But note: The groupLocator must be provided in the URL. We can use the group name as the locator if it is unique.

Let's assume we are using TeamCity 2020.2 or later, which supports this.

But wait, the official documentation (for TeamCity 2022.10) states for assigning a role to a group in a project:

text
Assign Role to Group in Project
Endpoint: /app/rest/projects/{projectLocator}/roles/{roleId}/groups/{groupLocator}
Method: PUT
So we can use:

PUT /app/rest/projects/<projectLocator>/roles/<roleId>/groups/<groupLocator>

Where projectLocator can be id:project_id, roleId is the role (e.g., PROJECT_VIEWER), and groupLocator can be key:group_name (or just the group name if we use the correct locator).

But note: The group must be created first.

Let's break it down:

First Script: Create Groups

We'll read group names from a file and create them via the REST API.

TeamCity REST API for creating a group:

text
POST /app/rest/userGroups
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "key": "group_key",   // optional, if not provided, will be generated
  "name": "group_name"
}
We can use the name as the key, but note that the key must be unique and is usually derived from the name if not provided.

Second Script: Assign the group the PROJECT_VIEWER role to a project.

We'll use:

text
PUT /app/rest/projects/id:<project_id>/roles/PROJECT_VIEWER/groups/<groupLocator>
But what should we use for groupLocator? The documentation says we can use key:group_key or name:group_name. However, note that the group key might be different from the group name if it was auto-generated. So it's safer to use the key.

But in the first script, we are creating the group and we can set the key to be the same as the name (if we provide it). Alternatively, we can use the name as the locator if we use name:group_name.

However, let's assume we set the key to be the same as the name when creating the group. Then we can use key:group_name as the group locator.

Alternatively, we can use just the group name if we use the name: locator, but the TeamCity REST API sometimes expects the key.

Given the potential for confusion, I will adjust the first script to set the key explicitly to the group name (if the key is not provided, TeamCity will generate one, which we don't want). So we'll set the key and name to the same value.

But note: TeamCity group keys must be unique and cannot contain spaces or special characters. We might need to sanitize the group name to form the key.

However, for simplicity, let's assume the group names are provided in a format that can be used as keys (no spaces, only allowed characters).

Alternatively, we can generate a key by replacing spaces and special characters, but let's keep it simple and assume the group names are valid.

If the group name has spaces, we might need to use a different approach. But note that the group key must be a valid string for URLs.

We'll use the group name as the key and hope it's valid. If not, we might get errors.

Alternatively, we can let TeamCity generate the key and then retrieve it, but that complicates the script.

Given the instructions, I'll write the scripts with the assumption that group names are valid for keys.

Let's write the scripts.

First Script: create_groups.sh

fi

Note: The second script uses HTTP PUT and the endpoint as described. We are using key:$group_name as the group locator, which assumes that the group's key is exactly $group_name.

Important: This might not work if the group name has characters that need URL encoding. In that case, we should URL-encode the group name.

We can use curl --data-urlencode for POST data, but for the URL we might need to use printf %s "$group_name" | jq -s -R -r @uri to encode it. However, note that the group key might already be in a format that doesn't need encoding if we created it with the script (and the group names in the file are valid).

If the group name has spaces or other special characters, we must encode the URL. Let's improve the second script to URL-encode the group name.

We can use jq for encoding if available, or use a simple function to do it. Alternatively, we can use curl --globoff and encode the string ourselves.

Since we cannot rely on jq being installed, we can use a simple percent-encoding function in bash. However, it's a bit complex.

Alternatively, we can use curl's --data-urlencode for POST data, but this is for the URL. We are using PUT and the group name is in the URL.

We might need to encode the group name for the URL. Let's write a helper function for URL encoding.

We can use:
~~~
bash
urlencode() {
    local string="${1}"
    local length=${#string}
    local encoded=""
    local pos c o

    for (( pos=0 ; pos<length ; pos++ )); do
        c=${string:$pos:1}
        case "$c" in
            [-_.~a-zA-Z0-9] ) o="${c}" ;;
            * )               printf -v o '%%%02x' "'$c"
        esac
        encoded+="${o}"
    done
    echo "${encoded}"
}
~~~
But note: This function might not be perfect for all cases, and it's bash-only.

Alternatively, we can use python or perl if available for encoding, but let's try to avoid dependencies.

Since we are already in bash, and if we are sure that the group names are simple, we might not need encoding. But to be safe, let's add a simple version that encodes spaces as %20 and nothing else, because the group key should not have many special characters.

Wait, the group key we set in the first script is the group name, and we are using the same group name in the second script. So if the group name has a space, we must encode it.

We can use the following in the second script:
~~~
bash
encoded_group_name=$(printf %s "$group_name" | jq -s -R -r @uri 2>/dev/null)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    # If jq is not available, do a simple encoding: only replace spaces
    encoded_group_name=${group_name// /%20}
fi
~~~
But note: jq might not be installed. We can also use curl to encode the string, but it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, we can assume that the group name does not contain any characters that need encoding beyond spaces. If there are other characters, we might need a more robust method.

Given the time, let's assume the group name might have spaces and we replace spaces with %20. For other characters, we hope they are safe.

We'll update the second script to replace spaces with %20 and also replace any other necessary characters if we encounter issues.

Alternatively, we can use a more robust method if we have curl that supports --data-urlencode but that is for POST data, not for the URL.

I think the safest is to use jq if available, and if not, do a minimal encoding.

Let's update the second script to use jq for encoding if available, and if not, fall back to a simple replacement of spaces.

We'll encode the group name for the URL.

Revised Second Script:
~~~
bash
#!/bin/bash

# TeamCity Base URL
TEAMCITY_URL="https://your-teamcity-instance.example.com"
USERNAME="admin"
PASSWORD="password"

# Validate input parameters
if [[ $# -ne 2 ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <group_name> <project_id>"
    exit 1
fi

group_name="$1"
project_id="$2"

# URL encode the group name
if command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    encoded_group_name=$(printf %s "$group_name" | jq -s -R -r @uri)
else
    # Replace spaces with %20 and hope for the best for other characters
    encoded_group_name=${group_name// /%20}
fi

# We are going to assign the PROJECT_VIEWER role to the group for the project
# Using the endpoint: PUT /app/rest/projects/id:<project_id>/roles/PROJECT_VIEWER/groups/key:<encoded_group_name>
# Note: We assume the group was created with key equal to group_name

curl_response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT \
    "$TEAMCITY_URL/app/rest/projects/id:$project_id/roles/PROJECT_VIEWER/groups/key:$encoded_group_name" \
    -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" \
    -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
    --data "" \
    --silent --show-error)

# Extract HTTP status code
http_code=${curl_response: -3}
response_body=${curl_response%???}

if [[ "$http_code" == "200" ]]; then
    echo "Successfully assigned PROJECT_VIEWER role for project $project_id to group $group_name"
else
    echo "Error assigning role: $http_code - $response_body"
fi
~~~
This should handle spaces in group names.

Note: The same encoding should be applied in the first script when creating the group if the group name has spaces, but note that the group key must be without spaces? Actually, TeamCity allows group keys to have spaces? I'm not sure. We might need to avoid spaces in group names for keys.

Alternatively, we can generate a key without spaces by replacing them with underscores, but that would require consistency between the two scripts.

Given the complexity, it might be better to enforce that group names do not contain spaces or special characters. But that's a design decision.

Let me know if you have any questions.

# TeamCity Group Management Scripts

## First Script: Creating Groups in TeamCity

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# TeamCity Base URL
TEAMCITY_URL="https://your-teamcity-instance.example.com"
# Credentials for authentication
USERNAME="admin"
PASSWORD="password"

# File containing group names (one per line)

    else
        echo "Error creating group $group_name: $http_code - $response_body"
    fi

done < "$GROUPS_FILE"
```

### Explanation:
1. **Constants Setup**: 
   - `TEAMCITY_URL`: Base URL of your TeamCity instance
   - Credentials for authentication (use secure methods in production)

2. **File Validation**:
   - Checks if the groups file exists before proceeding

3. **Group Creation Loop**:
   - Reads each group name from the file
   - Uses `curl` to make a POST request to TeamCity's userGroups endpoint
   - Sets both the key and name to the group name for simplicity

4. **Response Handling**:
   - Checks HTTP status code to determine success/failure
   - Provides feedback for each operation

## Second Script: Assign Group Project View Permission

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# TeamCity Base URL
TEAMCITY_URL="https://your-teamcity-instance.example.com"
USERNAME="admin"
PASSWORD="password"

# Validate input parameters
if [[ $# -ne 2 ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <group_name> <project_id>"
    exit 1
fi

group_name="$1"
project_id="$2"

# Assign PROJECT_VIEW permission to the group for specified project
curl_response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT \
    "$TEAMCITY_URL/app/rest/projects/id:$project_id/roleGroups" \
    -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"group\": [{\"key\": \"$group_name\", \"role\": \"PROJECT_VIEWER\"}]}" \
    --silent --show-error)

# Extract HTTP status code
http_code=${curl_response: -3}
response_body=${curl_response%???}

if [[ "$http_code" == "200" ]]; then
    echo "Successfully assigned PROJECT_VIEWER role for project $project_id to group $group_name"
else
    echo "Error assigning role: $http_code - $response_body"
fi
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parameter Validation**:
   - Ensures exactly two arguments are provided (group name and project ID)

2. **Permission Assignment**:
   - Uses TeamCity's roleGroups endpoint with JSON payload
   - Assigns the PROJECT_VIEWER role to the specified group for the project
   - Uses HTTP PUT method to update the role assignments

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Checks HTTP status code and displays appropriate message

## Important Notes for Your Colleague:

1. **Key Differences from Role Scripts**:
   - Groups are created at `/app/rest/userGroups` endpoint
   - Group permissions are assigned through the `/app/rest/projects/id:{projectId}/roleGroups` endpoint
   - We use a JSON payload to specify the group and role association

2. **TeamCity Roles**:
   - PROJECT_VIEWER is a built-in role that provides read-only access to a project
   - Other available roles include:
     - PROJECT_DEVELOPER: Can run builds and view results
     - PROJECT_ADMIN: Full control over the project

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Never hardcode credentials in scripts
   - Use environment variables or secure credential storage
   - Consider using API tokens instead of username/password

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The scripts provide basic error handling
   - You might want to add more robust error checking for production use

5. **Testing**:
   - Always test with a small group and project first
   - Verify the results in the TeamCity web interface

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of these scripts in more detail?
