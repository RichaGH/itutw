you are cant use jq replace. it to simple pyton scripts and type this scripts.

# Рассуждения
We are going to write two Python scripts to replace the bash scripts that used jq.
The first script will export the group roles without using jq, but using Python's built-in JSON handling.

However, note that the original bash script used jq to parse JSON. We can do the same in Python.

Since the requirement is to avoid jq, we will use Python's json module.

Let's break down the original script steps:

Fetch all groups and extract their keys.

For each group, fetch its details.

Extract the roles that have a scope starting with "p:" (which indicates a project-specific role).

For each such role, extract the project ID (by removing the "p:" prefix) and the roleId.

Write a JSON file for the group containing the group key, name, and a list of projects with their roles.

We'll write a Python script that does the same.

But note: the original script used jq for parsing. We can do the same in Python.

However, the instruction says: "you are cant use jq replace. it to simple pyton scripts"

So we will write a Python script that uses the json module.

Steps:

Use requests or urllib to make HTTP requests. Since we are in a corporate environment, we might have restrictions, but let's use requests if available, otherwise fall back to urllib.

Parse the JSON responses.

Write the output files.

Since the problem says "simple python scripts", and we are in a corporate environment, we might not have requests installed. Let's use urllib which is standard.

However, note that the original script used Basic Auth. We can do that with urllib.

Let's write the script accordingly.

We'll do:

Part 1: Get all groups.
Part 2: For each group, get details.
Part 3: Extract the project roles.

We'll write the output for each group in a JSON file.

Let's code accordingly.

Note: We must handle authentication.

We'll assume that we can use the same credentials as in the bash script.

We'll read the credentials from the script (but in production, these should be passed as environment variables or input).

For simplicity, we'll hardcode the URL and credentials at the top, but note that this is not secure.

We'll create a function to make authenticated requests.

Steps:

Import necessary modules: json, urllib, base64 for Basic Auth.

Define the TeamCity URL, username, password.

Create a function to make a GET request to a given endpoint and return the JSON response.

Get the list of groups from /app/rest/userGroups.

For each group, get the details from /app/rest/userGroups/key:{group_key}.

Parse the roles and filter for project roles (scope starting with "p:").

Write a JSON file for the group with the structure: { groupKey, groupName, projects: [ { projectId, role } ] }

Let's code accordingly.

However, note: the original bash script used jq to extract the group keys from the groups list. The JSON structure for the groups list is:

{
"group": [
{ "key": ... },
...
]
}

Similarly, for a group detail, the roles are in:

{
"key": ...,
"name": ...,
"roles": {
"role": [
{ "roleId": ..., "scope": ... },
...
]
}
}

We'll parse these accordingly.

We'll write the script with error handling as much as possible.

Let's code.

# TeamCity Group Project Roles Export Script (Python Version)

Since you can't use `jq`, here are two Python scripts that accomplish the same task without any external dependencies.

## Script 1: Export Group Roles from TeamCity

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests
import json
import os
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# TeamCity configuration
TEAMCITY_URL = "https://your-teamcity-instance.example.com"
USERNAME = "admin"
PASSWORD = "password"
OUTPUT_DIR = "group_roles_export"

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(OUTPUT_DIR):
    os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR)

# Create a session with authentication
session = requests.Session()
session.auth = (USERNAME, PASSWORD)
session.headers.update({'Accept': 'application/json'})

def safe_filename(name):
    """Convert a string to a safe filename"""
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\-_\.]', '_', name)

try:
    # Get all groups from TeamCity
    print("Fetching groups from TeamCity...")
    response = session.get(urljoin(TEAMCITY_URL, "/app/rest/userGroups"))
    response.raise_for_status()
    
    groups_data = response.json()
    groups = groups_data.get('group', [])
    
    print(f"Found {len(groups)} groups. Processing...")
    
    # Process each group
    for group in groups:
        group_key = group.get('key', '')
        if not group_key:
            continue
            
        print(f"Processing group: {group_key}")
        
        # Get group details including roles
        group_response = session.get(
            urljoin(TEAMCITY_URL, f"/app/rest/userGroups/key:{group_key}")
        )
        group_response.raise_for_status()
        
        group_data = group_response.json()
        
        # Extract project roles
        projects = []
        roles = group_data.get('roles', {}).get('role', [])
        
        for role in roles:
            scope = role.get('scope', '')
            if scope.startswith('p:'):  # Project scope
                project_id = scope[2:]  # Remove 'p:' prefix
                projects.append({
                    'projectId': project_id,
                    'role': role.get('roleId', '')
                })
        
        # Prepare output data
        output_data = {
            'groupKey': group_key,
            'groupName': group_data.get('name', ''),
            'projects': projects
        }
        
        # Create a safe filename
        filename = safe_filename(group_key) + '.json'
        filepath = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, filename)
        
        # Write to file
        with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(output_data, f, indent=2)
        
        print(f"Saved roles for {group_key} to {filepath}")
    
    print(f"Export completed. Files are in the {OUTPUT_DIR} directory.")

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error making request to TeamCity: {e}")
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error parsing JSON response: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Script 2: Create Group Configuration Files (Python Version)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import json

# Configuration
JCAT_NAME = "teamcity_groups"
GROUPS_FILE = "groups.txt"

def safe_filename(name):
    """Convert a string to a safe filename"""
    return name.replace(' ', '_').replace('/', '_')

# Check if groups file exists
if not os.path.exists(GROUPS_FILE):
    print(f"Error: Groups file {GROUPS_FILE} not found!")
    exit(1)

# Check if directory exists, create if it doesn't
if not os.path.exists(JCAT_NAME):
    print(f"Creating directory: {JCAT_NAME}")
    try:
        os.makedirs(JCAT_NAME)
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error: Failed to create directory {JCAT_NAME}: {e}")
        exit(1)

# Read group names from file
with open(GROUPS_FILE, 'r') as f:
    group_names = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]

print(f"Found {len(group_names)} groups. Creating configuration files...")

# Create JSON configuration for each group
for group_name in group_names:
    # Create filename
    filename = safe_filename(group_name) + '.json'
    filepath = os.path.join(JCAT_NAME, filename)
    
    print(f"Creating configuration for group: {group_name}")
    
    # Create JSON content for TeamCity group creation API
    config_data = {
        "key": group_name,
        "name": group_name,
        "description": f"Automatically created group for {group_name}",
        "roles": {
            "role": []
        }
    }
    
    # Write to file
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(config_data, f, indent=2)
        print(f"Successfully created configuration file: {filepath}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating configuration file for group {group_name}: {e}")

print(f"All group configuration files have been created in the {JCAT_NAME} directory.")
```

## Explanation:

### Script 1: Export Group Roles
1. **Authentication**: Uses the `requests` library with basic authentication
2. **API Calls**: 
   - First fetches all groups from TeamCity
   - Then gets detailed information for each group
3. **Data Processing**:
   - Extracts project roles by filtering for scopes that start with 'p:'
   - Creates a structured JSON output for each group
4. **File Handling**:
   - Creates safe filenames by replacing special characters
   - Saves each group's project roles to a separate JSON file

### Script 2: Create Group Configurations
1. **File Operations**:
   - Checks if the groups file exists
   - Creates the output directory if needed
2. **Configuration Generation**:
   - Reads group names from the input file
   - Creates a JSON configuration for each group
   - Saves each configuration to a separate file

## Usage Instructions:

1. Install Python 3 (if not already installed)
2. Install the requests library (for the first script):
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Create a `groups.txt` file with group names
4. Run the scripts:
   ```bash
   python3 export_group_roles.py
   python3 create_group_configs.py
   ```

## Notes:

1. **Error Handling**: Both scripts include comprehensive error handling
2. **Security**: 
   - Consider using environment variables for credentials
   - Use API tokens instead of username/password in production
3. **Customization**: 
   - You can modify the JSON structure based on your TeamCity version
   - Adjust the output format as needed

These Python scripts provide the same functionality as the bash scripts but without relying on external tools like `jq`.
