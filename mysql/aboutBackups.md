## Ответ

To back up a MySQL database without stopping the database service, you can use several tools and methods. Here are some popular options:

### 1. **`mysqldump` with `--single-transaction`**
   - **`mysqldump`** is a command-line utility provided by MySQL for creating backups.
   - The `--single-transaction` option ensures a consistent backup by starting a transaction before dumping the data, which allows the database to remain operational during the backup process.

   **Command Example:**
   ```bash
   mysqldump --single-transaction -u [username] -p[password] [database_name] > backup.sql
   ```

   - Replace `[username]`, `[password]`, and `[database_name]` with your MySQL credentials and database name.
   - The backup will be saved to `backup.sql`.

### 2. **Percona XtraBackup**
   - **Percona XtraBackup** is a powerful open-source tool for backing up MySQL databases without downtime.
   - It works well for large databases and supports incremental backups.

   **Steps:**
   1. Install Percona XtraBackup:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install percona-xtrabackup
      ```
   2. Run a full backup:
      ```bash
      xtrabackup --backup --user=[username] --password=[password] --target-dir=/path/to/backup
      ```
   3. Prepare the backup (if needed):
      ```bash
      xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/path/to/backup
      ```

   - Replace `/path/to/backup` with your desired backup directory.

### 3. **MySQL Enterprise Backup**
   - **MySQL Enterprise Backup** is a commercial tool provided by Oracle for backing up MySQL databases.
   - It supports hot backups (without downtime) and is optimized for InnoDB tables.

   **Command Example:**
   ```bash
   mysqlbackup --user=[username] --password=[password] --backup-dir=/path/to/backup backup
   ```

---

### 4. **Third-Party Tools**
   - **phpMyAdmin**: If you have a web-based interface, you can use phpMyAdmin to export the database without stopping MySQL.
   - **Automated Backup Scripts**: You can write custom scripts using `mysqldump` or other tools to automate backups.

---

### 5. **Replication-Based Backups**
   - Set up a replication slave and take backups from the slave server. This ensures the master server remains unaffected during the backup process.

---

### Key Considerations:
- **Consistency**: Use `--single-transaction` or tools like XtraBackup to ensure data consistency.
- **Storage**: Ensure you have enough disk space for the backup.
- **Automation**: Schedule regular backups using cron jobs or other scheduling tools.
