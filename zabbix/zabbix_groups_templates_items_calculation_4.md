# Вопрос

ok. You has metrics in zabbix. But on time from 3-5 metrics has zerro value. how to explain it? Second question: when you are look into "values" in zabbix you can see several values and time of it, but average time value minute + - 5 second, but you are add Preprocessing "Change per second" and think about all values must be every second delta value in store. Why zabbix show only one value in minute? if it because perion=1m then how to interpretate 0 values?

# Рассуждения

We are facing two issues:

Some metrics (3-5) have zero values at times.

The data is stored at one-minute intervals, but we expected per-second deltas due to the "Change per second" preprocessing.

Let's address each issue:

Issue 1: Zero Values
There are several reasons why you might see zero values:

A. Network Interface Counters Reset
Network interface counters (like net.if.in[ens192,bytes]) are cumulative and can reset (e.g., on interface restart, system reboot, or counter overflow). When Zabbix calculates the delta (change per second) and the counter resets, it might result in a zero or a very large number (if overflowed). However, Zabbix is designed to handle counter overflows for 64-bit counters, but resets to a lower value might cause issues.

B. No Traffic
There might be periods of no network traffic, so the delta is zero.

C. Agent Issues
The Zabbix agent might not be able to collect the data at that moment (e.g., agent too busy, network issues, permission problems).

D. Preprocessing Issue
The "Change per second" preprocessing might be failing for some reason.

How to Investigate Zero Values:
Check the raw counter values:

Create an item without preprocessing to collect the raw counter (cumulative bytes). Then you can see if the counter reset or if it's increasing.

Check for agent errors in the agent log.

Check the timing of the zero values:

If they occur at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) it might be due to a high system load at that time.

Issue 2: Why Only One Value Per Minute?
You have set the update interval to 60 seconds (1 minute). Therefore, Zabbix will collect the value every minute. The "Change per second" preprocessing does not mean that Zabbix will store the value every second. It means that when Zabbix collects the value (every minute), it will calculate the change per second from the previous value and the current value, and then store that rate in units per second.

Example:
Let's say the cumulative counter for network incoming bytes:

At time T0: 1000 bytes

At time T1 (60 seconds later): 1600 bytes

The change is 600 bytes over 60 seconds. The "Change per second" preprocessing will calculate: 600 / 60 = 10 bytes per second.

So the stored value will be 10 (bytes per second) at time T1.

Why Not Per-Second?
If you want per-second granularity, you must set the update interval to 1 second. However, note that:

This will increase the load on the Zabbix server and the database.

The "Change per second" preprocessing for a 1-second interval would be: (current_value - previous_value) / 1, which is the same as the delta.

But note: network interface counters might not update every second, and the agent might not be able to collect every second reliably.

How to Interpret Zero Values in This Context?
If you see a zero value, it means that during that minute interval, the cumulative counter did not change (or the change was zero). This could be because:

There was no traffic.

The counter reset and the delta was negative, so Zabbix might set it to zero (depending on the preprocessing settings).

Recommendations:
For the zero values:

Check the raw counter items to see if the counter is resetting.

If the counter resets, you might need to use the "Change per second" preprocessing with a custom multiplier of 1 and ensure that the "Store value" is set appropriately (but in Zabbix 6.0, it's the preprocessing that handles the delta).

For the per-second data:

If you require per-second data, set the update interval to 1s and use the "Change per second" preprocessing. But be cautious of the load.

Alternative approach for network traffic:

Use the net.if.in[ens192] and net.if.out[ens192] items (without the ,bytes parameter) which return the rate in bytes per second. These items are designed to give you the rate without needing preprocessing.

However, note that these items (without ,bytes) are also collected at the interval you set and then the rate is calculated by the agent. The agent internally uses the same method (delta of counters divided by time) but it might be more reliable.

Steps to Change:
For the zero values, try:
Use the rate items (without ,bytes):

net.if.in[ens192] ? returns bytes per second

net.if.out[ens192] ? returns bytes per second

Then you don't need the "Change per second" preprocessing.

If you still see zero values, check the agent log and the network interface status.

For the per-second data:
Change the update interval to 1s for the items you want per-second.

Be aware that this will generate 60 times more data and might require more resources.

Conclusion:
The zero values might be due to no traffic, counter resets, or agent issues.

The data is stored every minute because the update interval is 60 seconds. The "Change per second" preprocessing calculates the rate per second, but it's still stored once per minute.

If you need further assistance, please provide more details about the zero values (e.g., when they occur, if they are random or periodic, and the raw counter values).

# Ответ

Great questions! Let me explain both issues in detail.

## Issue 1: Zero Values from 3-5 Metrics

### Common Causes of Zero Values:

**1. Agent Connection Issues:**
- Zabbix agent temporarily unavailable
- Network connectivity problems
- Agent overloaded and missing collection windows

**2. Interface-Specific Issues:**
- Network interface `ens192` going down/up
- Interface reset or reconfiguration
- Driver issues on the monitored host

**3. Timing Issues:**
- Collection happening during interface statistics reset
- Counters wrapping around (32-bit to 64-bit or vice versa)

**4. Preprocessing Issues:**
- "Change per second" getting confused by counter resets
- First collection after agent restart

### How to Diagnose:

**Check the raw counters without preprocessing:**
- Create a temporary item with key `net.if.in[ens192,bytes]` 
- **No preprocessing** - set type to "Numeric (unsigned)"
- Check if the raw counter is increasing monotonically
- If raw counter decreases or resets, that's the issue

**Monitor interface status:**
```bash
# On the monitored host, check interface status
ip link show ens192
cat /sys/class/net/ens192/operstate
```

## Issue 2: Why Only One Value Per Minute Despite "Change per second"

### Understanding Zabbix Collection Architecture:

```
Collection Cycle:
Time 00:00:00 - Agent collects value A
Time 00:00:05 - Network blip (agent can't collect)
Time 00:00:10 - Network blip (agent can't collect)  
Time 00:00:15 - Agent collects value B
Time 00:01:00 - Zabbix processes: (B - A) / 60 seconds = stores ONE value
```

### The Misconception:

**"Change per second" ? "Store every second"**

What actually happens:
1. **Agent collects** raw counter values periodically (every 60s in your case)
2. **Zabbix server** applies preprocessing when it receives the value
3. **"Change per second"** calculates: `(current_value - previous_value) / time_difference`
4. **Result**: One processed value stored per collection interval

### Why You See ±5 Second Variations:

- **Agent scheduling**: Zabbix agent doesn't run exactly on the second
- **System load**: Collection might be delayed by high CPU usage
- **Network latency**: Small delays in transmitting data to server

## Solutions:

### For Zero Values:

**1. Add Error Handling in Preprocessing:**
```
Preprocessing steps:
1. Change per second
2. Custom multiplier: 1
3. Discard unchanged: ? (prevents storing zeros)
```

**2. Create Triggers for Data Gaps:**
```sql
{Template:net.if.in[ens192].nodata(180)}=1
```
This triggers if no data for 3 minutes.

**3. Use Trend Functions in Graphs:**
Instead of relying on every data point, use:
```
avg(//net.if.in[ens192],5m)
```

### For Better Time Resolution:

**1. Increase Collection Frequency:**
- Change update interval from `60s` to `30s` or `15s`
- **Warning**: This increases server load significantly

**2. Use Dependent Items for Different Timeframes:**

**Per-second rate** (what you have now):
- Update interval: `60s`
- Preprocessing: `Change per second`

**Per-minute total**:
```bash
# Create a new item:
Name: "Bytes per minute on ens192"
Type: Dependent item  
Master: "Network incoming rate on ens192"
Preprocessing: Custom multiplier ? 60
```

**3. Use Zabbix Trapper for Custom Collection:**
Create a script that collects every second and sends via `zabbix_sender`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    bytes_in=$(cat /sys/class/net/ens192/statistics/rx_bytes)
    bytes_out=$(cat /sys/class/net/ens192/statistics/tx_bytes)
    zabbix_sender -z zabbix-server -s "hostname" -k net.bytes.in -o $bytes_in
    zabbix_sender -z zabbix-server -s "hostname" -k net.bytes.out -o $bytes_out
    sleep 1
done
```

## Interpretation of Your Data:

### What Zero Values Mean:

**Scenario 1**: Single zero between normal values
- **Likely**: Brief network outage or agent delay
- **Action**: Usually ignorable if infrequent

**Scenario 2**: Multiple consecutive zeros  
- **Likely**: Interface down or agent stopped
- **Action**: Investigate host connectivity

**Scenario 3**: Regular pattern of zeros
- **Likely**: Preprocessing issue with counter resets
- **Action**: Check raw counter behavior

### Current Setup Reality Check:

Your current setup with 1-minute intervals is actually **industry standard** for network monitoring because:

1. **Network traffic is bursty** - 1-minute averages smooth out noise
2. **Storage efficiency** - 1 data point/minute vs 60 data points/minute
3. **Adequate for capacity planning** - trends matter more than second-to-second changes

## Recommended Approach:

**Keep 1-minute intervals** but:

1. **Add these items for troubleshooting**:
   ```bash
   # Raw counters without preprocessing
   net.if.in[ens192,bytes] -> "Raw bytes received"
   net.if.out[ens192,bytes] -> "Raw bytes transmitted"
   ```

2. **Use these for monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # With change per second preprocessing
   net.if.in[ens192,bytes] -> "Receive rate (Bps)"
   net.if.out[ens192,bytes] -> "Transmit rate (Bps)"
   ```

3. **Create calculated items for totals**:
   ```bash
   # Bytes per hour = (rate ? 3600)
   last("Receive rate (Bps)") * 3600
   ```

This approach gives you both detailed troubleshooting data and practical monitoring metrics without overwhelming your Zabbix installation.
